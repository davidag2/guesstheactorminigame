How to Use:
Create three files: index.html, styles.css, and script.js.
Download images of actors and name them accordingly (e.g., tom_hanks.jpg, leo_dicaprio.jpg, emma_watson.jpg).
Update the actors array in script.js with the actor names and image filenames.
Open index.html in your web browser to play the game.
You can deploy these files to Vercel or any other static hosting service by creating a new project and uploading these files.
